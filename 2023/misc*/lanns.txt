as we are using faketr approach 
using extended 4ma cross  in tf >= m30 

and a ma acts as S&R
so it is given that if price in a SAFE stock (a stock which is in *UPtrend may not be that strong in momentum etc like AFFORDABLE etc less FORCEMOTO) is safe meaning previous close of candle will not be broken in near future .. 
So the retest from that lline will have strong momentum 
 .

so using risk management rule of mine that to book profit no greed 

better to buy again if want to traded in that stock  no other watchlist candidate
